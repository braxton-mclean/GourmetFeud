# GourmetFeud
 
Gourmet Feud is a Turn-based Tactical-RPG for the class Fundamentals of Game Design at GSU.  

The gameplay is akin to Final Fantasy Tactics in battle style, where Units take turns on the battlefield individually rather than as a collective like Fire Emblem and Advance Wars.  

At most this is meant to be a functional prototype of a tactics-game engine with a cute story to allow exploration of different battle mechanics and styles.
